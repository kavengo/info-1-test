# Task 2: Answering Questions with Python (2 Points)

For the following questions, ﬁnd an expression in Python which gives you the desired answer.

Each answer should be saved in a variable named `task_n` where `n` is the index of the subtask. 
E.g. the solution to subtask 3 should be named `task_3`. 
The ﬁle script.py already contains such variables for each tasks. 
Do not change the name of these variables.

1. Find a Python expression that checks the following equality:
Is ((65^17 % 3233)^413 ) % 3233 equal to 65?
Store the result of this expression in the provided `task_1` variable (its value has to be True).

2. Implement a user input that asks for a name. 
Find a way to store in a ﬁrst step the ﬁrst two letters and in a second step the lats two letters in separate variables. 
Example: The input "heisenberg" should result in "he" and "rg".

    ```python
    
    name = # implementation of the input 
    task_2_p1 = # needs to contain the first two letters 
    task_2_p2 = # needs to contain the last two letters
    
    ```

3. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. 
"level" is an example of a palindrome. 
Write a Python expression that checks if "level" is a palindrome. 
Store the result of this expression in the `task_3` variable.

4. Find a Python expression that checks if a string is part of another string using membership operators.
You have to check whether the string "king" is contained in the string "breaking bad". 
Store the result of this expression in the provided `task_4` variable.

5. Find a Python expression that when given a string creates a new string with the original string repeated multiple times:
Given `"Python is cool!"` create the string `"Python is cool!Python is cool!Python is cool!"`
Store the result of this expression in the provided `task_5` variable.

6. In a calculation you received a value of 1/3.
Write a Python expression that stores this value in form of a decimal value with two decimal digits (0.33). 
Store the result of this expression in the provided `task_6` variable.

    *Note*: First deﬁne the variable percentage to be 0.333333333. 
    Then ﬁnd how to format the string contained in this variable to a string rounded to two digits after the decimal point.
